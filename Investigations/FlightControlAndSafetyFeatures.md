# Flight Control and Safety Features

## Software Specific Project Deliverables

### 1. Flight Control & Stability
Develop and tune custom control algorithms, integrating with an autopilot framework, to ensure responsive and stable operation.

### 2. Safety Features
Implement robust software failsafes (e.g., loss-of-signal handling, emergency landing logic, automatic recovery modes) to minimize risk during testing.

### 3. Validation & Testing 
Apply software-in-the-loop (SITL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations to rigorously validate flight control and safety systems prior to real-world flights.

## Implementation Strategy

### Achieving Deliverable #1: Flight Control & Stability

**Integration with Autopilot Framework**
- Implement communication between our custom scripts and ArduCopter through MavProxy
- Establish MAVLink communication protocols for telemetry and command exchange

**Parameter Management**
- Configure pre-flight parameter sets optimized for high-speed operations
- Implement parameter changing for different phases of flight (slow vs fast)

**Adaptive Flight Control**
- Set flight parameters that adjust based on real-time conditions
- Ensure responsive and stable operation across varying speeds and flight modes using these parameters
- Monitor system performance and adjust control sensitivity dynamically (Stretch goal currently)

### Achieving Deliverable #2: Safety Features

**Flight Envelope Protection**
- Implement comprehensive monitoring systems for speed, altitude, attitude, and battery status. Keep in mind that the list will change so keep design flexible.
- Deploy real-time alerting for envelope violations
- Enable automatic emergency mode switching when critical thresholds are exceeded

**Integrated Failsafe Systems**
- Leverage built-in ArduCopter failsafes (loss of signal, low battery, GPS failure)
- Implement additional software-based safety checks and recovery procedures

### Achieving Deliverable #3: Testing & Validation

**SITL Testing Framework**
- Create comprehensive test scripts using Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulation
- Validate control algorithms and safety features in simulated environments
- Implement automated testing for various flight scenarios and failure modes

### Actions from investigation?
- Plan out realistic time table with team and decide highest priority things.
- At a minimum someone can implement basic mav proxy scripts and get multi gcs working with a custom script.
