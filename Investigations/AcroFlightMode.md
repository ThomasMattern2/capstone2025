### Direct Rate Control
- Normal stabilize mode: stick input commands a specific angle (e.g., "tilt to 30 degrees and stop") with built-in max and minimums.
- Direct rate control in "ACRO" mode: stick input commands rotation speed, allowing unlimited angles and sustained tilts
- ACRO enables faster horizontal flight by maintaining aggressive tilt angles without automatic leveling
- This is ideal for fast flight as you can bank something like 60 degrees for speed
